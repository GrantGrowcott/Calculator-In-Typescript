# TypeScript Calculator Project

I have taken my previous calculator project in node.js and converted it into typeScript.

Begin with the following 

`npm i @types/node`

Run the typeScript transpiler

`tsc`

Then run node.js ( The calculator.js file is located in the dist directory)

`node dist/calculator.js`


Thanks for the views.
